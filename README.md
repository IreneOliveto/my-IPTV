# IPTV-Italy

Repository containing a playlist of all major Italian TV channels.

This list started from [Tundrak's project](https://github.com/Tundrak/IPTV-Italia) and is aiming to be constantly updated with any new working public link while removing dead links.

All requests to add new channels will be accepted (no matter the political or social orientation of the channel), as long as a public working stream and a logo are provided.
